\subsection{Pixel Tracker Calibrations}

The CMS SiPixel detector is integral to the High-Level Trigger (HLT) decision-making process.\\
This part of the report delves into the calibration prospects of the SiPixel detector, emphasizing unused records, FED cabling, gain and quality calibrations, Cluster Position Estimator (CPE) conditions, and alignment practices.\\
Future prospects and recommendations for improving calibration workflows under the NGT framework are also discussed.\newline \newline 
Out of the 326 conditions in the HLT GT, 13 are related to the Silicon Pixel Tracker, of which 12 are relevant to Run 3 data-taking. From these, the following 8 are considered core and critical for data-taking:

\subsubsection{Unused Records in SiPixel Calibration}
Several records remain unused at HLT but hold relevance for other operational aspects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{SiPixelDetVOffRcd}: Lists detector IDs with HV or LV off. Payload is ideal or empty.
    \item \texttt{SiPixelGainCalibrationOfflineRcd}: Stores gain and pedestal values for offline analysis.
    \item \texttt{SiPixelLorentzAngleRcd ("from alignment")}: Contains Lorentz Angle offsets, outdated since 2017.
    \item \texttt{SiPixelTemplateDBObjectRcd ("0T")}: Used during 0T templated tracking for PixelRecHits.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{FED Cabling and Calibration Maps}
The \texttt{SiPixelFedCablingMapRcd} records cabling maps connecting FEDs to readout channels. While not a direct calibration, this record plays a vital role in detector topology and reconstruction. This was last updated in 2017 with the transition to the Pixel Phase-1 detector.

\subsubsection{Bad components}
Description: This payload contains the DetIDs and ROCs associated with those DetIDs that are considered "dead." Used by tracking.\\
Record Name: \texttt{SiPixelQualityRcd} 

\subsubsection{Pixel hit position reconstruction}

The position of a pixel cluster in the transverse (\(u\)) and longitudinal (\(v\)) directions on the sensor is determined by projecting the cluster onto the respective axis and summing the charge collected in pixels with the same coordinate \cite{Tracking_2014}. For single-pixel clusters, the position is the center of the pixel, corrected for Lorentz drift. For larger clusters, the hit position (\(u_{\text{hit}}\)) is computed using the relative charge in the first and last pixels of the projected cluster:

\begin{equation}
u_{\text{hit}} = u_{\text{geom}} + \frac{Q_{\text{last}} - Q_{\text{first}}}{2(Q_{\text{last}} + Q_{\text{first}})} |W_u - W_u^{\text{inner}}| - \frac{L_u}{2},
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(Q_{\text{first}}\), \(Q_{\text{last}}\): Charges in the first and last pixels of the cluster.
    \item \(u_{\text{geom}}\): Geometric center of the projected cluster.
    \item \(L_u/2 = D \tan \Theta_u^{\text{L}}/2\): Lorentz shift, with \(\Theta_u^{\text{L}}\) as the Lorentz angle and \(D\) as the sensor thickness.
    \item \(W_u^{\text{inner}}\): Geometrical width excluding the first and last pixels, zero for clusters smaller than three pixels.
    \item \(W_u = D \left| \tan (\alpha_u - \pi/2) + \tan \Theta_u^{\text{L}} \right|\): Charge width, derived from the track impact angle (\(\alpha_u\)) and Lorentz angle.
\end{itemize}

If no track is available, \(\alpha_u\) is assumed based on the particle's origin at the CMS detector center. The formula accounts for the partial charge deposition in the first and last pixels, estimating the extension of charge into these pixels (\(W_u - W_u^{\text{inner}}\)), which ranges between zero and twice the pixel pitch. This extension, combined with the relative charge, provides the edges of the charge distribution. The mean value of these edges, corrected for Lorentz drift, yields the cluster position.

For pixel barrel detectors, the Lorentz shift is approximately 59~\(\mu\)m.

\subsubsection{Pixel Lorentz Angle}
Description: The 'no label' payload contains the value of LorentzAngle / Tesla for the Barrel Pixel and Forward Pixel separately (due to different HV constants, geometry, etc.).\\
Record Name: \texttt{SiPixelLorentzAngleRcd} 
Labels = none, \texttt{fromAlignment} or \texttt{forWidth} - given when included in a global tag.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{fromAlignment} : the LA offset generated by alignment (alternative to LA correction from templates).
\item \texttt{forWidth}: the LA for charge width estimate in the generic CPE (alternative to the same LA as for offset). 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pixel Templates}
Description: used in the templated tracking algorithm for Pixel RecHits.
Record Name:  \texttt{SiPixelTemplateDBObjectRcd}. 
Radiation exposure in the pixel detector significantly impacts charge collection and degrades the performance of the standard hit reconstruction algorithm, particularly in highly irradiated sensors. To address this, a template-based reconstruction algorithm compares the observed cluster charge distribution to precomputed templates generated using the \texttt{PIXELAV} simulation.\\
Templates are created by simulating particle tracks traversing pixel modules at various angles. Each pixel is subdivided into nine bins along the \(u\) (or \(v\)) axis, and the charge profile of the cluster is projected into an array of 13 pixels (or 23 for \(v\)). Clusters with excessively high charges, distorted by energetic delta rays, are excluded. The mean charge \(\bar{S}_{i,j}\) and RMS charge distributions for each bin are computed, along with other relevant cluster properties.\\
The observed charge \(P_i\) in each pixel \(i\) is compared to the expected template charge \(S_{i,j}\) to determine the likely bin \(j\) where the particle crossed the sensor. This is achieved by minimizing the \(\chi^2\) function:
\[
\chi^2(j) = \sum_i \left( \frac{P_i - N_j S_{i,j}}{\Delta P_i} \right)^2,
\]
where \(\Delta P_i\) is the RMS charge uncertainty, and \(N_j\) normalizes the cluster charge to the template:
\[
N_j = \frac{\sum_i \frac{P_i S_{i,j}}{(\Delta P_i)^2}}{\sum_i \frac{S_{i,j}^2}{(\Delta P_i)^2}}.
\]
This approach provides the best estimate of the hit position, even for complex multi-pixel clusters.\\

For single-pixel clusters, the hit position is corrected for Lorentz drift and radiation damage using the average residual bias. For multi-pixel clusters, the hit position is refined by approximating the template charge near the best \(j\)-bin as \((1-r)S_{i,j-1} + rS_{i,j+1}\) and minimizing \(\chi^2\) with respect to \(r\).\\
The reconstruction algorithm is validated on PIXELAV simulation samples used to generate the templates. By comparing reconstructed and true hit positions, residual biases are determined and accounted for in collision data. The RMS of these differences defines the uncertainty in the reconstructed hit position, ensuring robust performance across varying conditions.

\subsubsection{Generic Errors}

Description: used in the generic CPE (cluster position estimation) algorithm as errors. Improves irradiation bias corrections (IBC) for data.
Record Name:  \texttt{SiPixelGenErrorDBObjectRcd}.

\subsubsection{Pixel Alignment}
Records used: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{TrackerAlignmentErrorRcd} (for alignment), 
\item \texttt{TrackerSurfaceDeformationRcd} (for surface deformation)  \item \texttt{GlobalPositonRcd} (defining the relative position of the subdetectors) 
\end{itemize}

Tracker alignment is tightly coupled with CPE conditions to mitigate Lorentz Angle miscalibrations \cite{CMS:2022ali}. High-granularity offline PCL helps optimize biases but is prone to weak modes.
HLT reconstruction uses the Pixel CPE Fast algorithm (a variant of the generic algorithm), while offline operations rely on Pixel Template reconstruction. Discrepancies between these algorithms necessitate customized alignment procedures.

The alternating orientation of the modules within each layer is indicated by the triangles. The blue (grey) circles represent the reconstructed hit positions using incorrect (correct) Lorentz angles in the presence of a magnetic field . The grey curve corresponds to a track built from the hits that were reconstructed with the correct Lorentz angles. Hits reconstructed with incorrect Lorentz angles are displaced in a direction defined by the orientation of the module, increasing the residual distance between the hits and the track. \cite{CMS:2022ali}}

\chapter{Optimal Calibrations}
\section{General} % FIXME: the sections structure should be re-arranged/intergrated into the main general structure (the Introduction.tex part was untouched)

%% General
% From NGT Proposal: 
% This task will optimize the calibration process for the CMS detectors, from hours currently, to an online predictive model leveraging AI techniques. Such an improvement is essential to push real-time analysis based on R3 software (task 3.1) to the same accuracy that we typically achieve offline. One could then store high-quality high-level information, which implies a big save in terms of storage.

% Deliverable/milestone: Production of a report illustrating the current calibration workflows in CMS and evaluating the impact of non-optimal calibrations on the physics performance of the online reconstruction.

\section{Calibration Workflows Analysis}
% Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current calibration workflows and procedures within CMS currently in place, understanding the intricacies of the process, and identify areas for improvement (bottlenecks) in the calibration process. 

% NOTE: The current preliminary survey focused on finding viable candidates for the prototype. A continued and more detailed follow-up survey is being planned, especially in the context of Phase 2 calibrations, including new detectors (MTD, HGCAL, new tracker, etc.)

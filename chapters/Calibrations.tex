%% General
% From NGT Proposal: 
The general goal of this task is to optimize the calibration process for the online data-taking of the CMS detector. Task 3.4 foresees to use advanced computing techniques such as predictive model leveraging AI techniques as well as improving traditional methods currently empoloyed in CMS.\\
Such an improvement is essential to push real-time analysis based on R3 software (task 3.1) to the same accuracy that we typically achieve offline. One could then store high-quality high-level information, which implies a big save in terms of storage.

% Deliverable/milestone: Production of a report illustrating the current calibration workflows in CMS and evaluating the impact of non-optimal calibrations on the physics performance of the online reconstruction.

\section{Calibration Workflows Analysis}
% Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current calibration workflows and procedures within CMS currently in place, understanding the intricacies of the process, and identify areas for improvement (bottlenecks) in the calibration process. 

% NOTE: The current preliminary survey focused on finding viable candidates for the prototype. A continued and more detailed follow-up survey is being planned, especially in the context of Phase 2 calibrations, including new detectors (MTD, HGCAL, new tracker, etc.)
